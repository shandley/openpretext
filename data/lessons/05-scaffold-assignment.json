  "introduction": "After cutting and joining contigs, the next step is organizing them into scaffolds (chromosome-level assemblies). Scaffold assignment lets you group related contigs and assign them to specific chromosomes.\n\nIn this lesson, you'll work with the crocodile genome to learn scaffold management: creating scaffolds, assigning contigs, reordering sequences, and using visual color bands to track your organization. This is essential for producing a chromosome-level assembly.",

      "instruction": "To work with scaffolds, switch to Scaffold mode using the mode selector in the toolbar.\n\nIn Scaffold mode, you can:\n• Create new scaffolds (chromosomes)\n• Assign contigs to scaffolds\n• Rename and color-code scaffolds\n• Reorder contigs within scaffolds\n\nScaffold mode also displays colored bands on the contact map, helping you visualize which contigs belong to which chromosome.",

      "title": "Create a New Scaffold",
      "instruction": "Let's create your first scaffold. In the scaffold panel (usually on the right side), click the 'New Scaffold' or '+' button.\n\nGive your scaffold a meaningful name like 'Chromosome 1' or 'Chr1'. You can also assign it a color to make it visually distinct on the map.\n\nScaffolds serve as containers for grouping related contigs into chromosome-level assemblies.",

      "instruction": "Now assign contigs to your new scaffold. There are several ways to do this:\n\n1. Select contigs in the map (click or Shift+click for multiple)\n2. Click 'Assign to Scaffold' and choose your scaffold\n3. The contigs will be grouped and colored accordingly\n\nTry assigning a few contigs that clearly belong to the same chromosome (look for contigs within the same diagonal block).",

      "instruction": "You can reorder contigs within a scaffold using drag-and-drop. This is especially useful for fine-tuning the linear order to match the Hi-C signal.\n\nTo reorder:\n1. Make sure you're in a mode that allows dragging (Edit or Scaffold)\n2. Click and hold on a contig in the sidebar\n3. Drag it to a new position\n4. Release to drop it\n\nThe contact map updates immediately to show the new ordering.",

      "instruction": "Practice reordering contigs to optimize the contact map. The goal is to maximize the bright signal along the diagonal.\n\nWhen contigs are in the correct order:\n• Strong signal stays on the diagonal\n• Off-diagonal artifacts decrease\n• Chromosome blocks look clean and square\n\nTry moving a few contigs around and observe how the contact pattern changes. Use undo if you make things worse!",
      "expectedAction": {

      "instruction": "Take a moment to review your scaffold assignments:\n\n• Check the scaffold panel to see which contigs are assigned\n• Look at the colored bands on the contact map\n• Verify that each scaffold contains contigs from a single chromosome block\n\nYou can create multiple scaffolds and assign different chromosome blocks to each one. This organizational structure is what gets exported when you save the curated assembly.",
      "expectedAction": {

You've learned scaffold assignment:\n\n• Creating new scaffolds (chromosomes)\n• Assigning contigs to scaffolds\n• Using drag-and-drop to reorder contigs\n• Visual feedback with colored bands\n• Reviewing and organizing your work\n\nScaffolds are the bridge between raw contigs and chromosome-level assemblies.
